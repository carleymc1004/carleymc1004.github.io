<div>I became a fan of DIR EN GREY at a relatively young age! I was scrolling around OG Youtube, I'm talking 2006-ish YouTube with the really star ratings all over the page. I was using it like most people do: watching music videos of course!
 I don't remember what I was watching leading up to my first DIR EN GREY music video, but I do remember the feeling when I watched their video! It was the music video called Cage.  I was absolutely mystified and transfixed!</div>
