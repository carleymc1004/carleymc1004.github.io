  <p>I remember the first time I saw a DIR EN GREY music video. It was on OG, 2006 Youtube with the really ugly rating stars that were everywhere. I was doing watching 
    music videos on YouTube, like most young teens do, even now. I don't remember what I was 
  watching leading up to discovering my new favorite band, but I remmember the feeling I felt when i first watched it. Absolute mysticism and fascination. 
    It was the music video for <b>Cage</b>. This was my first experience with music that wasn't in English, but that wasn't a thought in my mind. I still felt like I was 
    absorbing a story, I still felt compelled to watch more to see how it unravels. Then I watched another, then another. Then I watched interviews with badly translated subtitled.
    Then I started saving images and images to the family computer. Then i watched them perform live in horribly compressed youtube videos. I was hooked.
